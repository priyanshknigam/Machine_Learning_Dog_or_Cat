# Dogs Vs Cats Prediction Model (ML)
The repository consists of a jupyter notebook file containing the code for building, training and analyzing a deep neural network model, to identify whether an image is of a Dog or a Cat.

The Code uses Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense from keras.layers to build the deep neural network. Code also uses cv2, numpy, pandas, and os to load large set of data (24,946 images) as input to the model. And matplotlib to analyze the performance of the model. Model had an Accuracy of 89.61%.

The link to the source of the data used in the above code is also present in the notebook file.
